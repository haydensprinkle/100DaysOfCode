# 100DaysOfCode

A repository to store updates on my 100 Days of Code journey that will eventually be converted into a custom blog format

Day 1 (01/01/2021)

    -spent about an hour watching self-taught software engineer YouTubers to hype me up
    -created Git repo for 100 Days of Code challenge with plans to expand
    -continued work on recently started vanilla JS to-do app
        -scrapped styling due to a bug surrounding ::marker, going to focus on functionality first
        -added functionality for check button and delete button

Day 2 (01/02/2021)

    -Played around with flexbox positioning on my to-do app until I got sufficiently frustrated
    -Watched several hours of Colt Steele's updated Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy and completed various associated coding challenges focusing primarily on CSS fundamentals

Day 3 (01/03/2021)

    -Created a repository for projects from my Web Dev Bootcamp course on Udemy
    -Finished and pushed a race registration page for practice with forms

Day 4 (01/04/2021)

    -Learned about the different color systems used by CSS
    -Did research on the differences between various CSS frameworks including Bootstrap and Tailwind, also diving into the paradigms of object-oriented CSS and utility-first CSS
    -Practiced flexbox positioning with Flexbox Froggy
    -Contacted an open-source project (if-me.org) about joining as a contributor

Day 5 (01/05/2021)

    -Accepted as contributor for if-me.org
    -Attempted to get if-me project set up with Docker, got confused somewhere along the line and failed miserably
    -Reached out for help from the if-me dev community, waiting for a response
    -Finished the hell out of Flexbox Froggy to feel good about myself

Day 6 (01/06/2021)

    -Slow day, just worked through a chunk of freeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript modules

Day 7 (01/07/2021)
