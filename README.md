# 100DaysOfCode

A repository to store updates on my 100 Days of Code journey that will eventually be converted into a custom blog format

Day 1 (01/01/2021)    

    -spent about an hour watching self-taught software engineer YouTubers to hype me up
    -created Git repo for 100 Days of Code challenge with plans to expand
    -continued work on recently started vanilla JS to-do app
        -scrapped styling due to a bug surrounding ::marker, going to focus on functionality first
        -added functionality for check button and delete button

Day 2 (01/02/2021)

    -Played around with flexbox positioning on my to-do app until I got sufficiently frustrated
    -Watched several hours of Colt Steele's updated Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy and completed various associated coding challenges focusing primarily on CSS fundamentals
